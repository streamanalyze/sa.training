// 1. load the functions in recorded-signals


// 2. load the kmeans system model


// 3. generate an instance of kmeans named "chemproc" 


// 4. add the temperature and pressure data from temp_pressure_data()


// Good! Now go to usage.osql and look at the first graph.

// 5. Use :fit to train the k-means model.
// Use max_iter=10000 and num_cluster=5


// Done! Now go to usage.osql and look at the second and third graphs.
